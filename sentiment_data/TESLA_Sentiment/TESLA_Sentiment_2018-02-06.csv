Hello @ united. While people are upset about the inability to use a password manager (I simply copy and paste from my password manager) i have a bigger issue. Why is there no two factor authentication? The second static question is not 2FA. Thank you.,2018-02-05 16:07:11,0,0,0.199,0.744,0.058,-0.7013

@ united # unitedAIRLINES your airline is a complete joke. Between the lack of customer service and miscommunications I am convinced no one that works here as any clue as to what is going on.
